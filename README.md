## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the classic arcade game **Space Invaders**. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and must defend the Earth by shooting down waves of incoming alien invaders. The game is designed to be simple yet fun, offering a nostalgic experience reminiscent of the original 1978 game.

## Features

- **Player Control:** Move the spaceship left and right using the arrow keys and shoot with the spacebar.
- **Enemy Waves:** Aliens move across the screen, descending gradually as they reach the screen edges.
- **Scoring System:** Earn points by destroying aliens. The game keeps track of your score during each session.
- **Multiple Levels:** Survive waves of aliens that become progressively faster and more challenging.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when an alien reaches the bottom of the screen or when the player is hit by an alien bullet.

## Installation and requirements
